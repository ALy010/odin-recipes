    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Egyptian falafel, also known as ta'ameya, is a popular and savory street
      food in Egypt. It is made from a mixture of ground fava beans (or
      sometimes chickpeas), fresh herbs, onions, garlic, and various spices.
      <br />The ingredients are blended together into a thick paste, which is
      then shaped into small balls or patties and deep-fried until they develop
      a crispy, golden-brown exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traditional Egyptian falafel is distinct from the more common Middle
      Eastern version, which is made primarily with chickpeas. The fava
      bean-based ta'ameya imparts a unique flavor and texture, making it a
      beloved local delicacy.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Fava Beans</li>
      <li>Fresh Herbs</li>
      <li>Onions and Garli</li>
      <li>Spices</li>
      <li>Baking Powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the ingredients:</li>
      <li>
        Prepare the fava beans
        <ul>
          <li>
            If using dried fava beans, soak them in water overnight. If using
            chickpeas, soak them for at least 6 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            After soaking, drain the beans (or chickpeas) and rinse them
            thoroughly.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend the ingredients
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a food processor, add the soaked and drained fava beans (or
            chickpeas), chopped onion, garlic, cilantro, parsley, ground cumin,
            ground coriander, ground cardamom, baking powder, salt, and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pulse the mixture until it forms a coarse paste. Avoid
            over-blending; you want some texture in the mixture.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest the mixture
        <ul>
          <li>
            Transfer the falafel mixture to a bowl and cover it with plastic
            wrap.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the mixture rest in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
            This helps the flavors meld and the mixture to firm up, making it
            easier to shape.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape the falafel
        <ul>
          <li>
            After the resting period, take the falafel mixture out of the
            refrigerator.
          </li>
          <li>
            With slightly wet hands, scoop out small portions of the mixture and
            shape them into small balls or patties. The size can be about 1-1.5
            inches in diameter.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry the falafel
        <ul>
          <li>
            In a deep skillet or frying pan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high
            heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fry the falafel balls or patties in batches until they are golden
            brown and crispy on the outside.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the cooked falafel from the oil and place them on a plate
            lined with paper towels to absorb any excess oil.
          </li>
