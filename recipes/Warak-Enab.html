      dish is often enjoyed as an appetizer or a main course. Warak Enab offers
      a delightful blend of textures and tastes,<br />
      with the tangy grape leaves complementing the savory and fragrant filling.
      <br />Whether served hot or cold, this traditional Egyptian dish is a true
      culinary delight that reflects the richness of the region's flavors and
      traditions.
